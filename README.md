# React Typescript Code Editor Notebook

This project is an interactive browser-based coding environment that's similar to a Jupyter Notebook. It allows you to write, run, and save TypeScript and JavaScript code snippets, along with markdown notes and documentation.

## Installation

The application can be accessed from npm registry, but you need to have Node.js installed on your machine first.

1. To get started, open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

2. Copy code
   ```sh
   npx jsnote-ymw serve
   ```

3. Once the notebook.js file is opened, navigate to http://localhost:4005 and start coding and taking notes!
